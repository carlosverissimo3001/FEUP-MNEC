### Digital Business Models

- Emphasizes that digital transformation is about change, not just technology.
- Three types of digital transformation:
  - **New Entrants**: different business model and superior digital capabilities - enter an existing market offering a new value proposition.
    - Example: Uber, Airbnb.
  - **New business model for traditional players**: existings companies adopt a business model that is more appealing to their customers.
    - Example: Nordstorm transition to an omnichannel business model.
  - **Crossing industry boundaries**: companies that are successful in one industry use digital tactics to enter another industry or domain.
    - Example: Apple entering the music industry with iTunes.

- **Creating the Next Generation Enterprise**: Every other enterprise can use digital technologies to create, thus they don't necessarily offer a competitive advantage; The key is to differentiate the business by offering something new and compelling through digital vehicles.

- **Two Dimensions of Digital Business Models**:
  - Moving from controlled value chains to complex networked systems.
  - Transitioning from less familiarity with customer needs to better understanding and engagement​​.

### The DBM Framework

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/dbm_framework.png" alt="DBM Framework" width="500"/>
</p>

### Types of Digital Business Models

1. Suppliers: Partial knowledge of end customers, operating in the value chain of another enterprise.
   - As digitization progresses, suppliers are likely to lose power and be pressured to reduce prices.
   - Move up in the DBM framework by learning more and connecting with end customers.
   - Example: P&G.
2. Omnichannels: Provide access to products across multiple channels, focusing on understanding the end customer.
   - Move up in the DBM, acting on increased knowledge of end customers and their life events, and reducing customer churn.
   - Companies use big data and analytics, social media, sentiment analysis, and other tools as avenus for increasing their understanding of customers.
   - Example: Citibank.
3. Modular Producers: Offer plug-and-play products or services adaptable to various ecosystems.
   - To thrive, they need to constantly innovate their products & services ensuring that they are among the best options in the market.
   - They operate in a hypercompetitive environment, as it's usually easy for customers to switch to another provider, and the whole point of being a modular producer is being plug-and-play.
   - Example: Paypal.
4. Ecosystem Drivers: Establish a digital ecosystem, offering a range of services to meet customer needs.
   - Use their brand strength to attract participants, ensure a great customer experience, and offer a one-stop shopping.
   - Like omnichannels, they also inspire to "own" the customer relationship but more importantly, they want to become the destitation for a subset of their customers.
   - Example: Apple, Google​​.

**Moving Up & Right in the DBM Framework**:

- Digitization is the vehicle for moving up and right in the DBM framework:
  - Create a strong connection with end customers (move up), and
  - with other companies and suppliers that they partner with (move right), to meet more of the customers' needs.
