# Business Model for the Digital Economy - 3rd Class

> 25th September 2023 -- FEUP --> Key Features of the Digital Economy

## Two Dimensions of Business Models (cont. from last class)

- From controlled value chains (Ã  la Michael Porter circa 1980) to more- complex, networked systems.
  - to what extent they are part of a value chain that can be controlled (and that they believe they or someone must control),
  - or to what extent they are part of a more complex digital ecosystem, in which the dynamics are less about command and control and more about building maintaining, and using networks.
- From less familiarity with customer needs and life events to a better, closer understanding of them, resulting in better customer engagement.
  - how much they know about the needs of their end customers and how much they can know.

## Digital Business Models

- **Supplier**
  - producer that sells through other enterprises
- **Omnichannel**
  - integrated value chain that creates multiproduct, multichannel customer experiences to address real-life events
- **Modular Producer**
  - provider of plug-and-play products and services
- **Ecosystem Driver**
  - organizer of an ecosystem, a coordinated network of enterprises, devices, and customers to create value for all participants, which isthe destination in a particular domain (such as
shopping)

Many large companies operate in more than one model.
