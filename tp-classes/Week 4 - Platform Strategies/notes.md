### Switching costs?

- **Definition**: Switching costs are the costs that a consumer incurs as a result of changing brands, suppliers or products. Although most prevalent switching costs are monetary in nature, there are also psychological, effort- and time-based switching costs. While the goal for many companies is to lower switching costs for their customers, it is equally important for businesses to understand the switching costs that they themselves incur when they make changes to their own products, suppliers or brands.

### Case Study: Airbnb

Searching and matching is facilitated by the an enormous range of filters that allow users to find the perfect place to stay.

#### How does Airbnb facilitate price and payment?

Airbnb facilitates price and payment by allowing hosts to set their own prices and by charging a service fee to both hosts and guests. It also offers a wide range of payment options to guests such as PayPal, credit cards, and debit cards.

#### How does Airbnb builds trust?

Airbnb builds trust by allowing hosts and guests to review each other after a stay. It also offers a $1,000,000 Host Guarantee and a $1,000,000 Host Protection Insurance program.

#### What are the network effects?

The more users and hosts on AirBnb, the more valuable the platform becomes for both parties. With additional houses and apartments listed, travelers should expect more competitive prices and a wider range of options. With more travelers, hosts should expect more bookings and more revenue.
