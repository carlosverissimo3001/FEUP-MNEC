> The following case study covers the journey of AptDeco, a New York-based startup that operated an online marketplace for used furniture.

Let's understand the case first:

## 0. Introduction/Preface

Some quick notes:

- Founded in 2013, by two friends: Reham Fagiri and Kalam Dennis.
- Launched in 2014, in New York City.
- Profitability over rapid expansion approach.
  - Move Loot, the main competitor, had raised $20M in funding and was force to shut down after a whirlwind two years of national expansion.
- AptDeco wanted go get costs under control and its customer experience and service to be exceptional before raising huge amounts of capital.

### 0.1 The Problem/Opportunity

Now, with strong financial backing and heavy investments in customer experience, optimized logistics and data-driven efficient marketing, AptDeco faced a challange that any managed marketplace is excited to face:
they were supply, rather than demand, constrained, i.e, there are more buyers than sellers.

This lead to revisit their vision which was to be a frictionless one-stop-shop for everything customers need in their home. To be able to achieve this, they needed to expand. They started thinking about ways to scale the business profitably.

**Premise** : managing the supply-demand imbalance on their platform and rethinking their strategy to scale effectively in response to this challenge.

## 1. AptDeco Origins

June 2013: Fagiri moves out of Philadelphia to New York City after the end of her MBA program at Wharton. She was looking to sell furniture on Craigslist for extra cash.

When selling an old TV, she, by mistake, listed the wrong version. When a guy come to pick up the TV, he was upset and said that he would take the TV and would not paid for it. Fagiri was scared and concluded that $100 was not worth risking her safety.

In the meantime, a friend of hers, Dennis, had just been complaining about how long it took him to sell his sofa. Using the U-Haul truck she had rented from the move, the two decided to offer free delivery to the buyer of the sofa. The sofa was sold within hours.

Intrigued by this, they created several fake listings on Craigslist to test the hypothesis that free delivery would increase the likelihood of a sale. They found immediately that interest in their listings with free delivery was much higher than those without.

They quickly found that, a business like this would work really well in a city like NYC where traffic is a nightmare, parking is expensive, a lot of walk-ups and people don't have cars, let alone trucks.

### 1.2 First Customers

Fagiri pulled together a private beta site and soliciting emails sign-ups for early access. In the meantime, Dennis focusing on acquiring sellers to list their items on the platform.

In just few days, they had gathered over 1000 emails and secured close to 100 live listings.  In comparision to craigslist, sellers found an increase in interest from serious buyers.

Customer aquisition costs in a two-sided marketplace is unique in a sense that buyers start to become sellers as they need to make room for the new furniture they are buying. A few sellers also become buyers as they spent time on the site and compared their items to others listings, although less common.

Fagiri decide NOT to accept her corporate job offer and instead spent the summer of 2013 building a MVP for AptDeco. At this point, most deliveries were done by Fagiri and Dennis themselves.

This helped them understand how the customers lived and why they were buying/selling furniture. Most were going through life events like getting married, having kids, moving to a new city, etc. It helped them from a marketing perspective.

With no experience with startups, they decided to apply to Y Combinator, a startup accelerator in Silicon Valley. They gained acceptance to the Winter 2014 batch and moved to California.

### 1.3 Y Combinator

> <https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/aptdeco>

Y Combinator is a startup accelerator that invests in two batches of companies every year. Each batch is a three-month program where the founders work intensively with YC partners to get the company into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors.

Since 2005, YC has funded over 1,900 startups including Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, Instacart, Docker and Gusto.

AptDeco eventually raised enough capital to continue launcing the business. Fagiri and Dennis returned to NYC with a defined business model, a plan for scalabity and a vast alumni network to tap into along the way.

## 3. The Business Model

### 3.1 Existing Business Models for Used Goods Marketplaces

A marketplace for used goods could operate in a variety of different business models. The most common ones are:

- Reseller: the marketplace buys the goods from the seller and resells them to the buyer. This is the model used by [Cash Converters](https://www.cashconverters.com.au/).
- Consignment: the marketplace sells the goods on behalf of the seller and takes a commission. This is the model used by [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), Vinted and some others.

The reselling model offers more risk and typically offers less competitive prices to sellers than in a consignment model.

### 3.2 AptDeco's Business Model

AptDeco opted for a variation known as p2p managed marketplace. In this model, the platform facilitates the transaction between the seller and the buyer and provides value-added services such as delivery and assembly.

- The platform only owns the item once it has been sold and delivery has been scheduled.

This is important for two reasons:

- Same day pickup and delivery eliminate inventory and warehouse costs.
- Direct listing by sellers eliminates the need for a markup by the reseller.

Simple model:

- A seller lists an item for sale on the platform, free of charge.
  - They are free to set the price they want, but AptDeco provides a pricing recommendation.
- Once a buyer submitted a purhcase request via third party payment provider, the seller was paid the sale price minus the AptDeco commission. AptDeco arranged for pickup and delivery of the item based on the seller and buyer's availability and typically within 4-5 days.

### 3.3 How to decide which commission to charge?

AptDeco is the only used furniture managed marketplace offering white glove delivery services. Thus, they decided to charge a comission rate ranging from 19% to 33%. However, it was free to list on AptDeco and the sellers would often list on multiple platforms.

This could lead to sellers listing on AptDeco and selling on another platform. This is known as the free rider problem. However, sellers were surprised to faster than average sell-through rates on AptDeco and would feel like the commission was worth it.

On the buyers side, AptDeco's revenue comes from delivery fees. For AptDeco, delivery fees were more important than commission rates because achieving long-term profitability through comission rates would never be sustainable.

### 3.4 Delivery fee structure

Multiple delivery fee structures were tested and the current one is the following:

| Item Size | Price | Category |
| --------- | ----- | -------- |
| Small | $49 | Headboards, chairs, lamps, coffee tables, etc. |
| Medium | $84 | Dining sets, king beds, sofas, media consoles, etc. |
| Large | $139 | Loft & bunk beds, wardrobes, wall units, etc. |

From 2017, they introduced a structure variable by size, and from 2014 to 2016, they had a flat fee of $65, $74 and $77 respectively.
