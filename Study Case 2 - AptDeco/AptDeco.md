> The following case study covers the journey of AptDeco, a New York-based startup that operated an online marketplace for used furniture.

Let's understand the case first:

## 0. Introduction/Preface

Some quick notes:

- Founded in 2013, by two friends: Reham Fagiri and Kalam Dennis.
- Launched in 2014, in New York City.
- Profitability over rapid expansion approach.
  - Move Loot, the main competitor, had raised $20M in funding and was force to shut down after a whirlwind two years of national expansion.
- AptDeco wanted go get costs under control and its customer experience and service to be exceptional before raising huge amounts of capital.

### 0.1 The Problem/Opportunity

Now, with strong financial backing and heavy investments in customer experience, optimized logistics and data-driven efficient marketing, AptDeco faced a challange that any managed marketplace is excited to face:
they were supply, rather than demand, constrained, i.e, there are more buyers than sellers.

This lead to revisit their vision which was to be a frictionless one-stop-shop for everything customers need in their home. To be able to achieve this, they needed to expand. They started thinking about ways to scale the business profitably.

**Premise** : managing the supply-demand imbalance on their platform and rethinking their strategy to scale effectively in response to this challenge.

## 1. AptDeco Origins

June 2013: Fagiri moves out of Philadelphia to New York City after the end of her MBA program at Wharton. She was looking to sell furniture on Craigslist for extra cash.

When selling an old TV, she, by mistake, listed the wrong version. When a guy come to pick up the TV, he was upset and said that he would take the TV and would not paid for it. Fagiri was scared and concluded that $100 was not worth risking her safety.

In the meantime, a friend of hers, Dennis, had just been complaining about how long it took him to sell his sofa. Using the U-Haul truck she had rented from the move, the two decided to offer free delivery to the buyer of the sofa. The sofa was sold within hours.

Intrigued by this, they created several fake listings on Craigslist to test the hypothesis that free delivery would increase the likelihood of a sale. They found immediately that interest in their listings with free delivery was much higher than those without.

They quickly found that, a business like this would work really well in a city like NYC where traffic is a nightmare, parking is expensive, a lot of walk-ups and people don't have cars, let alone trucks.

### 1.2 First Customers

Fagiri pulled together a private beta site and soliciting emails sign-ups for early access. In the meantime, Dennis focusing on acquiring sellers to list their items on the platform.

In just few days, they had gathered over 1000 emails and secured close to 100 live listings.  In comparision to craigslist, sellers found an increase in interest from serious buyers.

Customer aquisition costs in a two-sided marketplace is unique in a sense that buyers start to become sellers as they need to make room for the new furniture they are buying. A few sellers also become buyers as they spent time on the site and compared their items to others listings, although less common.

Fagiri decide NOT to accept her corporate job offer and instead spent the summer of 2013 building a MVP for AptDeco. At this point, most deliveries were done by Fagiri and Dennis themselves.

This helped them understand how the customers lived and why they were buying/selling furniture. Most were going through life events like getting married, having kids, moving to a new city, etc. It helped them from a marketing perspective.

With no experience with startups, they decided to apply to Y Combinator, a startup accelerator in Silicon Valley. They gained acceptance to the Winter 2014 batch and moved to California.

### 1.3 Y Combinator

> <https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/aptdeco>

Y Combinator is a startup accelerator that invests in two batches of companies every year. Each batch is a three-month program where the founders work intensively with YC partners to get the company into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors.

Since 2005, YC has funded over 1,900 startups including Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe, Reddit, Instacart, Docker and Gusto.

AptDeco eventually raised enough capital to continue launcing the business. Fagiri and Dennis returned to NYC with a defined business model, a plan for scalabity and a vast alumni network to tap into along the way.

## 2. The Industry & Competition

## 3. The Business Model

### 3.1 Existing Business Models for Used Goods Marketplaces

A marketplace for used goods could operate in a variety of different business models. The most common ones are:

- Reseller: the marketplace buys the goods from the seller and resells them to the buyer. This is the model used by [Cash Converters](https://www.cashconverters.com.au/).
- Consignment: the marketplace sells the goods on behalf of the seller and takes a commission. This is the model used by [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), Vinted and some others.

The reselling model offers more risk and typically offers less competitive prices to sellers than in a consignment model.

### 3.2 AptDeco's Business Model

AptDeco opted for a variation known as p2p managed marketplace. In this model, the platform facilitates the transaction between the seller and the buyer and provides value-added services such as delivery and assembly.

- The platform only owns the item once it has been sold and delivery has been scheduled.

This is important for two reasons:

- Same day pickup and delivery eliminate inventory and warehouse costs.
- Direct listing by sellers eliminates the need for a markup by the reseller.

Simple model:

- A seller lists an item for sale on the platform, free of charge.
  - They are free to set the price they want, but AptDeco provides a pricing recommendation.
- Once a buyer submitted a purhcase request via third party payment provider, the seller was paid the sale price minus the AptDeco commission. AptDeco arranged for pickup and delivery of the item based on the seller and buyer's availability and typically within 4-5 days.

### 3.3 How to decide which commission to charge?

AptDeco is the only used furniture managed marketplace offering white glove delivery services. Thus, they decided to charge a comission rate ranging from 19% to 33%. However, it was free to list on AptDeco and the sellers would often list on multiple platforms.

This could lead to sellers listing on AptDeco and selling on another platform. This is known as the free rider problem. However, sellers were surprised to faster than average sell-through rates on AptDeco and would feel like the commission was worth it.

On the buyers side, AptDeco's revenue comes from delivery fees. For AptDeco, delivery fees were more important than commission rates because achieving long-term profitability through comission rates would never be sustainable.

### 3.4 Delivery fee structure

Multiple delivery fee structures were tested and the current one is the following:

| Item Size | Price | Category |
| --------- | ----- | -------- |
| Small | $49 | Headboards, chairs, lamps, coffee tables, etc. |
| Medium | $84 | Dining sets, king beds, sofas, media consoles, etc. |
| Large | $139 | Loft & bunk beds, wardrobes, wall units, etc. |

From 2017, they introduced a structure variable by size, and from 2014 to 2016, they had a flat fee of $65, $74 and $77 respectively.

### 3.5 The three components that support AptDeco's business model

#### 3.5.1 Taking Delivery In-House

Initially, the founders were planning on outsourcing deliveries. Inspired by Uber's early model business of luxury black car drivers, they wanted to outsource the delivery to moving companies that experienced demand fluctuations throughout the month. 

AptDeco planned on using the days of the month where delivert vans would be typically unused. This allows them to reduce costs and overhead while offering competitve prices to customers.

This model would not work for a few reasons:

- By outsourcing, they would lose valuable control over customer experience
  - They would get blamed for any issues with the delivery, even if they had no control over it.
- AptDeco faced similar demand swings as the moving companies and would be subject to their cancellation and delays as moving companies were prioritizing their own customers.

So, they decided to bring delivery in-house, starting with two movers an a truck.By 2019, they had 13 trucks and 60 delivery team members.

Customers were happy and it was actually cheaper long-term and better for the business, as it allowed them to solidify their value proposition.

The drivers were also responsible for examing the item when they picked it up and any issues would be reported to the customer service team.

#### 3.5.2 Proprietary Scheduling & Logistics Technology

AptDeco's primary competitive advantage was providing the cheapest, highest quality, and most scalable delivery experience in the market.

| - | AptDeco | Traditional Delivery |
| - | ------- | -------------------- |
| Cost (Average) | $90 | $150-$300 |
| Speed (Average) | 4-5 days | 10-21 days | 

Providing these kinds of delivery services at that cost and time is not easy. AptDeco invested heavily in proprietary scheduling and logistics technology to optimize the delivery process.

When an item is sold, buters could propose numberous delivery dates and times. AptDeco's technology would then optimize the delivery route for the driver, taking into account the location of the item, the buyer and the other deliveries scheduled for that day.

#### 3.5.3 Data-Driven Merchandising & Marketing

How to ensure sellers continue to return to the platform and feel like the commission is worth it?

- AptDeco dissects every componenent of an item listed to understand what drives a sale. This contributed to AptDeco's 7-10 average sell-through rate, which was higher than the industry average.

They initially outsourced marketing and analytics but soon realized that, to make conscious decision and understand the CAC and realise what is working or not, they needed to bring it in-house as it is diffcult to do well through an agency or third party.

Bringing delivery in house also helped them. For one, they benefited from branding its fleet of vans and the positive delivery experience led to an increase in WOM(Words of Mouth) referrals.

Subway advertising was also a big part of their marketing strategy.

In the launch years, subway advertising made up a large percentage of the marketing mix, followed closely by WOM referrals.

## 4. Replicating the model: D.C Metro Area

In 2015, they raise 1.3M in its first round funding.They hired a small team of engineers and operations leads to penetrate the NYC market, testing and iterating their business model and scaling playbook from what they learned during Y Combinator.

In the meantime, Move Loot, a competitor, was launching nationally via outsource third-party logistics partners and raised $20M in funding.

AptDeco early investors were growing impatient and wanted to see the company expand to other markets.

- In 2016, after 2 1/2 years in the NYC market and over 200% year-over-year growth, AptDeco decided to expand to another market.

How to choose the next market?

- Well, in NYC they learned their buyers were typically younger man and woman while sellers were typically older and skewed female. Both groups wanted to better their lives as their family and financial situations changed.
  - Diverse, growing and transient communities were the best fit for AptDeco's business model.
  - In addition, they need a market with similar logistics and population density to NYC.

They chose Washington D.C. metro area: The market was really similar to that of NYC in terms of population, median age and household income. It was also a transient market with a lot of young professionals moving in and out of the city driven by colleges, universities and well as international as mobile population in the government sector.

To reduce seller-acquisition challanges, they made inventory from the NYC market available to buyers in the D.C. market. The marketing primarly focused on WOM referrals and subway advertising.

The D.C. market was not sucessfull:

- Subway advertising was not showing significant ROI, when compared to NYC, which made CAC skyrocket.
- Without listings from D.C Metro sellers, buyers were limited to items from the NYC area, which strained the logistics network and increased delivery times.
  - AptDeco was not able to sustain long-distance delivery back and forth between NYC and D.C.

They were burning cash at an unsustainable rate and decided to pull out of the D.C. market after only 6 months. In the same time, Move Loot shut down completely.

## 5. Doubling Down On Tri-State Area

After a failed expansion to the D.C. market, AptDeco decided to focus on servicing theur core market. THey spent motnhts getting the business back on financial health and looked to understand what went wrong in D.C.

The key learning is that relying on one or two marketing channels for the mix is not enough. Without the cash necessary to invest in subway advertising, they needed to find other ways to acquire customers. Dennis taugh himself digital marketing and started to run Facebook and Google ads.

After months of trial and error, they had a healthy marketing mix that included subway advertising, WOM referrals, affiliate marketing, and digital marketing.

A refocus on delivery service quality and customer experience led to a significant increase in WOM organic referrals, becoming a key driver of low CAC and freeing up dollart to test new marketing channels.

AptDeco recognized the need for a streamlined and consistent brand voice, especially given its position as a two-sided marketplace with distinct user types. Buyers and sellers, although demographically different, showed varied engagement behaviors. The company identified the effectiveness of simplified, user-specific digital advertising campaigns that boosted conversion rates.

The focus shifted towards speaking clearly and consistently to all users, and the creative content evolved accordingly. Instead of skewing towards sellers, the approach broadened to cater to the existing two-sided marketplace, particularly in the Tri-State area. The goal was to convey the platform's value in just a few seconds to any user. Comparative advertising, highlighting top-selling brands like West Elm, became essential for driving clicks and conversions.

Furthermore, intentional retargeting through email campaigns played a crucial role in promoting conversions, encouraging buyers to relist purchased items, and facilitating the transition from buyers to sellers and vice versa. These efforts contributed to maintaining marketing profitability for AptDeco.

## 6. The Road Ahead

By 2019, AptDeco had reached solid point:

- Solid financial footing after two additional rounds of funding.
- Trend of measured growth and profitability.
- 20 team members, organized across: engineering, operations, customer experience and acquisition,
- 13 trucks with point of return to a small warehouse in Brooklyn.
- Diversified and efficient marketing mix across WOM, digital, affliate.
  - Subway advertising had been mostly phased out and CACs had remained low and predictable.

Founders, alongside their investors, started to think about expansion opportunities and how to scale the business. With additional four years of testing, iterating and perfecting the model since the D.C experince, the pair had a bright vision for the future of AptDeco with several options to consider.

### 6.1 Super Users

Advised by Y combinator experts, the pair considered tapping into super users:

- high volume professional buyers and sellers who drive significant listings and lower acquisition costs.

For example, Airbnb caters to a wide variety of hosts, like rental companies, property managers, hotel operators and more, with a suite of professional hosting tools and software. Uber offered an uber-taxi option by relying on fleets of professional drivers.

#### 6.1.1 Vintage Stores and Small Furniture Retailers

Aptdeco can provide an alternative solution for retailers to have an online storefront and resell inventory taking up valuable and costly warehouse space. Many traditional sellers do not have the knowhow to start their own online stores.

As offline sales suffer from a reduction in foot traffic, eCommerce is becoming increasingly important for retailers. 

#### 6.1.2 Interior Designers

The US interior design history is very valuable and is highly fragmented with over 100000 businesses and operated by 150000 freelancers or independent designers.

Traditionally, interior designers have scoured antiques and high-end designer outlets to find unique pieces for their clients, often building exclusive relationships with antiques dealers. However, the industry has faced challenges, including a 1.5% annualized decline in demand from 2015 to 2019 due to factors such as tighter margins, smaller budgets, and heightened client expectations. To adapt to these changes, interior designers have started looking for more cost-effective options without compromising aesthetics.

AptDeco introduced an Interior Design Program early on, allowing designers to register as trade members and receive a 5% discount on their purchases. Nevertheless, the company had not yet implemented targeted marketing campaigns or allocated specific spending towards interior designers.

#### 6.1.3 Real Estate Brokers

In the dynamic environment of New York City, where the average 21-38-year-old resident moves every 1.7 years (an 18% increase over the past decade), the real estate market is notably competitive and expensive. Real estate brokers play a central role in this market, dealing with a variety of property types, including rentals, co-ops, condos, cond-ops, and sales. They charge substantial fees, often as high as 15%, for their services. Of particular interest is the luxury housing segment, where brokers manage complex sales processes in upscale buildings, requiring expertise in home staging and marketing, both online and offline.

In 2019, nearly 30% of real estate brokers chose to stage apartments before listing them, spending an average of $2,000 to $5,000 on renting or buying staging furniture. This investment was expected to yield a 5% return on investment based on the final selling price. With a staggering number of over 50,000 licensed real estate brokers in the five boroughs of NYC, this group of super users presented a unique opportunity for AptDeco. Brokers could serve as both buyers of staging items and sellers once the staging process was complete. Moreover, brokers had valuable connections with large property management companies that oversaw more than 1,000 apartment buildings throughout the city, providing AptDeco with access to a substantial potential user base and insights into property turnover.

### 6.2 New Market Expansion

### 6.3 Rebranding with Sustainability Focus

### 6.4 Sustainable Growth

Founders were excited about the potential of each of these options, and felt ready to handle the challanges ahead.
